Description: HermesFS is a Rust-based FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) program that provides 
  efficient and flexible file system functionalities. This program is designed to abstract the 
  complexities of streaming data to the cloud, and giving application developers a simple file 
  based interface to write data. In embedded systems, you may have large development groups 
  working on various components throughout the system. Application developers may want to add the 
  ability to stream captures or other data from their application to the cloud for analysis. 
  The developers shouldn't need to worry about how to stream that data, this is where HermesFS makes 
  dreams come true. The application developers can simply write to a file, and the HermesFS 
  implementation will take care of the rest, ensuring that the data is streamed to the cloud as 
  intended by the platform maintainers. This allows the application developers to focus on their 
  core functionality, while the platform maintainers can ensure that the data is streamed correctly 
  and efficiently.
 .
 This package provides the binary for running HermesFS
 on devices.
