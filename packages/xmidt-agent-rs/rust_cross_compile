# This package uses Rust cross-compilation for non-native architectures.
# When building for a different architecture than the host:
# - Rust target will be added via rustup
# - Cross-compiler toolchain will be installed
# - RUST_CROSS_TARGET environment variable will be set
# - Appropriate CARGO_TARGET_*_LINKER will be set
#
# Your build script should use: cargo build --target $RUST_CROSS_TARGET (if set)
