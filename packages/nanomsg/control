Description: High-performance implementation of scalability protocols - runtime
 nanomsg is a socket library that provides several common communication
 patterns. It aims to make the networking layer fast, scalable, and easy
 to use. Implemented in C, it works on a wide range of operating systems
 with no further dependencies.
 .
 The library provides implementation of several scalability protocols:
 PAIR, BUS, REQREP, PUBSUB, PIPELINE, and SURVEY. These protocols can
 run over various transports such as TCP, IPC, and inproc (in-process).
 .
 This package contains the runtime library.
